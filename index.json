[{"content":"Overview This certification is considered an entry level certification for technical professionals who configure, operate and troubleshoot desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearables, smart devices, networking equipment, virtualization and cloud computing services within their careers.\nThis is considered the first professional level certification in the IT operations and cyber security career pathways.\nThese are spread out across five domains or areas of knowledge.\nMobile Devices : Domain one is known as mobile devices, and it makes up 15% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to install and configure laptops and other mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, as well as your ability to support applications on these various devices and to ensure connectivity for your end users. Networking : The second domain is known as networking, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to make up 20% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to explain the types of networks and connections that are available in the workplace. This includes TCP/IP, wifi, small office and home office equipment and configurations and much more. Hardware : When we get to domain three, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be focused on hardware, and this is going to make up 25% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to identify, use and connect hardware components and devices, including how different devices are used to support a remote or hybrid workforce. When you think about this domain, I want you to be thinking about motherboards and processors and memory and storage drives and expansion cards and things like that and how we combine all of those together to create a functioning computer, workstation or server. Virtualization and Cloud Computing : Domain four is virtualization and the cloud, and this is going to be 11% of your exam questions. Now this domain is actually the shortest and smallest domain on the exam, but it is critically important in today\u0026rsquo;s modern enterprise networks because most organizations have placed a heavy emphasis on migrating their servers and systems and data centers into the cloud. You\u0026rsquo;re going to be expected to be able to compare and contrast different cloud computing deployment and delivery models, as well as your ability to understand how virtualization works to support these cloud-based architectures. Hardware and Network Troubleshooting : The fifth and final domain is known as hardware and network troubleshooting, and it makes up 29% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to troubleshoot real world devices and network issues very quickly and effectively using the CompTIA\u0026rsquo;s seven step troubleshooting method and applying your knowledge from all of the other four domains in order to answer questions about how you might solve a given problem or identify a particular cause for an issue being experienced by your end users.
