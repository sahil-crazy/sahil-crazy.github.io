[{"content":"Overview This certification is considered an entry level certification for technical professionals who configure, operate and troubleshoot desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearables, smart devices, networking equipment, virtualization and cloud computing services within their careers.\nThis is considered the first professional level certification in the IT operations and cyber security career pathways.\nThese are spread out across five domains or areas of knowledge.\nMobile Devices : Domain one is known as mobile devices, and it makes up 15% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to install and configure laptops and other mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, as well as your ability to support applications on these various devices and to ensure connectivity for your end users. Networking : The second domain is known as networking, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to make up 20% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to explain the types of networks and connections that are available in the workplace. This includes TCP/IP, wifi, small office and home office equipment and configurations and much more. Hardware : When we get to domain three, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be focused on hardware, and this is going to make up 25% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to identify, use and connect hardware components and devices, including how different devices are used to support a remote or hybrid workforce. When you think about this domain, I want you to be thinking about motherboards and processors and memory and storage drives and expansion cards and things like that and how we combine all of those together to create a functioning computer, workstation or server. Virtualization and Cloud Computing : Domain four is virtualization and the cloud, and this is going to be 11% of your exam questions. Now this domain is actually the shortest and smallest domain on the exam, but it is critically important in today\u0026rsquo;s modern enterprise networks because most organizations have placed a heavy emphasis on migrating their servers and systems and data centers into the cloud. You\u0026rsquo;re going to be expected to be able to compare and contrast different cloud computing deployment and delivery models, as well as your ability to understand how virtualization works to support these cloud-based architectures. Hardware and Network Troubleshooting : The fifth and final domain is known as hardware and network troubleshooting, and it makes up 29% of your exam questions. This domain is focused on your ability to troubleshoot real world devices and network issues very quickly and effectively using the CompTIA\u0026rsquo;s seven step troubleshooting method and applying your knowledge from all of the other four domains in order to answer questions about how you might solve a given problem or identify a particular cause for an issue being experienced by your end users.

And what makes a computer a computer? Well, in the old days, it was pretty easy to determine what was a computer. For example, back in the 1980s, every elementary school kid could recognize a computer as something that looked like an Apple II with its black and green screen, its huge case with an integrated keyboard, and the external floppy disk drive.\nOver time though, computers began to look more like a traditional PC, or a personal computer, with a color monitor or display that was separate from the computer itself. Another separate device was called a tower, and that contained all the hardware including your motherboard, processor, memory, storage, and other devices inside of a tower-like case. And then you\u0026rsquo;d have a keyboard and mouse that would connect to the tower using either a PS/2 connection, or in modern times, a USB cable.\nFor something to be considered a computer, it has to do four basic functions. These are input, processing, storage, and output. Now, as you can see, everything we just described meets the definition of a computer because it takes some kind of input, does some processing and storage, and then provides an output.\nSo, to help clarify and classify these different computers into more distinguishable and clear items, we\u0026rsquo;re going to break them down into a few key terms. This includes workstation, server, laptop, tablet, smartphone, smartwatch, smart device, and internet of things, or IoT devices.\nWorkstation : This is a computer that usually sits on your desk and has either a tower-based case or is an all-in-one style display case. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a desktop PC, this is a workstation. Server : In the physical sense, this is generally going to be a rack-mounted computer that\u0026rsquo;s used to host some kind of service, like a file and print sharing server, or something like a web server, which hosts my website, sahil-crazy.github.io. Laptop : Now, a laptop is a smaller and more mobile version of a workstation. In general, these laptops are going to run a standard desktop operating system like Windows, OS X, Linux, or maybe even Chrome OS. They\u0026rsquo;re going to be very similar to a regular desktop, but they can operate using an embedded battery instead of being plugged in all the time to a wall outlet. And this makes them great for people who travel a lot. In the old days, laptops were usually under power compared to a regular workstation, but these days, that really isn\u0026rsquo;t the case, and both workstations and laptops can have fast processors and use lots of memory to provide excellent performance to you. Tablet : Now, a tablet is a portable computer that generally consists only of a touchscreen display and the computing hardware needed to run it. This removes the need for a keyboard and a mouse since you can really type on a virtual keyboard that\u0026rsquo;s on the screen instead of having to use an external keyboard, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use a mouse cause you simply touch on the screen what you want to interact with. If you\u0026rsquo;re using an Android tablet, an iPad, or even a Kindle Fire, these are considered tablets. Now, some laptops actually have the ability of doing what\u0026rsquo;s called a two-in-one, where they can flip the laptop over and you move the screen to the back and it acts more like a tablet. In general, these two-in-one devices could be considered both a laptop and a tablet. And if you had to classify it as one for the exam, I would recommend you do it based on the operating system it uses. If it uses Windows or Linux, then it\u0026rsquo;s going to be considered a laptop. If it uses Android or iOS, then you should classify it as a tablet. Smartphone : Now, smartphones are essentially smaller versions of tablets but they also can be used to make phone calls. Most of us own and use a smartphone every single day, so I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you understand what it is. Now, most smartphones are either going to be Android or iOS for their operating system, and that\u0026rsquo;s generally how we categorize those two different types of smartphones is based on their operating system. Smart Devices : Now, smart devices are an entire category of devices that have the ability to compute things, but usually don\u0026rsquo;t have a traditional keyboard and mouse to operate them. For example, if you have a Google Home or Alexa device in your office, you have a small screen and a speaker for the output from that device, and that input is actually going to be your voice. Internet of Things or IoT : These are really any other device that connects to a network, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t clearly fit into any other categories that I just mentioned. For example, if you have a refrigerator that connects to the internet and can tell you when you\u0026rsquo;re running low on milk, that is an IoT device. Now, in addition to the four basic functions of a computer, being input, processing, storage, and output, there are a few common components that most computers are going to rely on. These are categorized as hardware, software, and firmware.\nHardware : Hardware is the parts of a computer that you can pick up, move around, open, and close. It is the physical thing that you interact with inside of that computer. Hardware includes devices that we use for input, processing, storage, and output, too. Input Devices : Input devices are hardware components that allow users to interact with a computer or other electronic device by providing input in the form of data or commands. Input devices include things like keyboards, mice, microphones, and webcams. Processing Devices : Hardware is going to be used for processing as well, things like the central processing unit, known as the CPU, or the graphics processing unit, or GPU. These devices are really the brains of the computer and they\u0026rsquo;re going to be used to control everything that a computer is doing. When we deal with the processing in a computer, our goal is to take some kind of input as data and convert it into something useful and usable. Storage Devices : Storage is the act of saving data for future use or retrieval. Temporary Storage : Our computers have a very small and very fast type of storage known as a cache, which is actually part of your CPU, or processor. Another temporary storage area that computers have is known as memory, or RAM. Permanent Storage : In terms of permanent or long-term storage, we can use things like hard disk drives, solid state drives, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and other things like that. Output Devices : Output devices are hardware components that allow a computer or other electronic device to communicate information to the user or to other devices. Output devices include components like monitors or displays, speakers, and even printers. So, as you can see, we use hardware to conduct input, processing, storage, and output, but we also use software to fully utilize the hardware for its specific task.\nSoftware : Software is actually going to be used to provide instructions to the hardware and tell it exactly what you want it to do. There are really three main types of software that you\u0026rsquo;re going to come across. These are operating system software, application software, and drivers. Operating System Software : It is used to provide a standard method for saving, retrieving, changing, printing, and transmitting information and data within the computer. Typical operating systems include things like Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, and many others that are out there. Application Software : It is going to be used to create, store, modify, and view information or data that you are going to create. This includes things like Microsoft Word, Adobe Premiere, Firefox, and others that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using on a daily basis. Drivers : A driver is a specific type of software that\u0026rsquo;s going to be used to translate commands from the operating system to a specific piece of hardware. For example, if I go and install a new video card in my workstation, Windows is probably going to be able to detect it and use a generic driver to at least understand how to display the images on the screen for me using that graphics card. But if I install the specific drivers for that video card from its manufacturer, it\u0026rsquo;s going to tell Windows how to better utilize the graphics card for increased performance or a higher quality output to that display. Besides hardware and software, we have something else which is called firmware.\nFirmware : This is really a combination of both hardware and software, and it\u0026rsquo;s put onto a single chip. Often, we call it software on a chip. Firmware is a specialized type of software that\u0026rsquo;s contained on the chip that\u0026rsquo;s going to be attached to the motherboard, optical drive, video card, mass storage host adapter, network card, modem, or printer. Firmware used to be harder to upgrade than other software because it only existed on that specialized chip. In the old days, you actually had to pull out that chip and replace it to upgrade the firmware. But these days, most firmware is upgradeable and this is done through a process called flashing. Because of this, we call most modern firmware flashable because you can actually update the software on that chip to take advantage of new advances in technology that might have arised since they manufactured that device.
